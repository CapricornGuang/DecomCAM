## Framework
Interpreting complex deep networks, notably pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), is a formidable challenge. Current Class Activation Map (CAM) methods highlight regions revealing the model's decision-making basis but lack clear saliency maps and detailed interpretability. To bridge this gap, we propose DecomCAM, a novel decomposition-and-integration method that distills shared patterns from channel activation maps. Utilizing singular value decomposition, DecomCAM decomposes class-discriminative activation maps into orthogonal sub-saliency maps (OSSMs), which are then integrated together based on their contribution to the target concept. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that DecomCAM not only excels in locating accuracy but also achieves an optimizing balance between interpretability and computational efficiency. Further analysis unveils that OSSMs correlate with discernible object components, facilitating a granular understanding of the model's reasoning. This positions DecomCAM as a potential tool for fine-grained interpretation of advanced deep learning models.

## Reproducibility
We provide the code based on a popular deep learning interpretation repository [pytorch-grad-cam](https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam/tree/master/pytorch_grad_cam). Besides, we also provide the colab 
```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ checkpoints # folder to store pretrained models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cam # the implement of various CAM methods
